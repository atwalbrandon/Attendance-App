# Attendance-App
A mobile app that takes class attendance by having students swipe an ID card. Requires a card scanner peripheral.
Made by Brandon Atwal, Jacob Danel, Anthony Chen, and Owais Ashraf for our senior project.

This mobile Android app reads students UTD ID cards (comet cards) and transmit the information to a desktop attendance application provided by Professor John Cole via Bluetooth. More information can be found in the project proposal and presentation slide.

Installation of the mobile app on a mobile device can be done via Android Studio. The desktop app can be unzipped and run on any Windows device. Ensure the mobile and desktop devices are already paired over Bluetooth, then run the desktop app and begin attendance. Then run the mobile app, which should automatically attempt to connect to the desktop app.
