# Attendance-App
A mobile app that takes class attendance by having students swipe an ID card. Requires a card scanner peripheral.
Made by Brandon Atwal, Jacob Danel, Anthony Chen, and Owais Ashraf for our senior project.

This mobile Android app reads students UTD ID cards (comet cards) and transmit the information to a desktop attendance application provided by Professor John Cole via Bluetooth. More information can be found in the project proposal and presentation slide.
